                  Biological data is accumulating faster than people’s capacity to analyze them. Our research interests and goals revolve
                  around mitigating this issue in the context of “<i>information to inference</i>” scope. At USU, Dr. Kaundal has developed an <b>independent</b> and <b>collaborative</b>
                  research program in bioinformatics, primarily focusing on computational mining of large multi-dimensional -<i>omics</i> datasets, and computational modeling using
                  supervised (Machine Learning) and unsupervised (Bayesian-based) learning. Our group is actively developing novel tools and software to apply the gained knowledge
                  towards organismal improvement. Research in KAABiL laboratory generally falls under the following major program objectives:
