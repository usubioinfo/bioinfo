        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          The development environment is the environment in which the local version of the website will run while you test it.
          The reason we test locally is so that we don't run testing on the live site with people possibly using it.
          It also reduces the chances of us accidentally breaking a page. This means we basically have to run the live site on
          our workstations, which means we need to download and install the tech stack.<br><br>
          As of August 27, 2021, our tech stack consists of
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="kbl-link">NodeJS</a>,
          <a href="https://expressjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="kbl-link">Express</a>,
          <a href="https://sass-lang.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="kbl-link">SASS</a>, and
          <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="kbl-link">Nunjucks</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          This tech stack consists of server-side frameworks and client-side frameworks. The server-side parts are not necessary to
          make changes to the website, and only exist to process the Nunjucks pages and turn them into HTML for us, as well as parse the
          SASS.
        </p>
        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          First, you'll want to install NodeJS on your Linux machine with
          <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="kbl-link">this guide</a> (use Option 2, an outdated version of Node might not work), or on MacOS with
          <a href="https://www.newline.co/@Adele/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-macos--22782681"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="kbl-link">this guide</a>.
          To make sure Node is installed, check your installation in a terminal with
          <code>node -v</code>
          and make sure you also have NPM with
          <code>npm -v</code><br>
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          Last, we'll go ahead and install Nodemon and ts-node-dev with NPM:<br>
          <code>sudo npm install nodemon ts-node-dev -g</code><br>
          The <code>-g</code> flag installs this globally on your computer, which is why you'll need to run
          it with <code>sudo</code>. This allows you to use Nodemon and ts-node-dev on any application. Now your development
          environment is set up.<br><br> Time to start
