        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          To get the website on your machine, first find a folder in which you want to put it on your computer, and then run<br>
          <code>git clone git@github.com:MusicDev33/bioinformatics.git</code><br>
          Once you've cloned the repository, go into the 'bioinformatics' folder that was created and type
          <code>npm install</code>. This will install all the NPM packages in that folder.<br>
          You don't have to run it this time, but everytime you want to edit the website, you'll want to run <br>
          <code>npm run update</code> to get all the new changes.
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          To run the website locally, all you need to do is type <code>npm start</code> in a terminal in the 'bioinformatics' folder. 
          Now you can open your browser to
          <code>http://localhost:3000</code>
          (or <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="kbl-link">click here</a>)
          and you'll be able to see your changes. Just refresh the page when you make a change. Ctrl+R also refreshes web pages as well.
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          When you've made changes that you're satisfied with, you can use <code>Ctrl+C</code> to quit one of the processes running in one of
          the terminals. Use <code>git add -A</code> to stage all of your changes, and
          <code>git commit -m "Your message here"</code> commit your changes. To push your changes
          to the server, use <code>git push -u origin master</code>. Now your changes are on the GitHub server!
          Also, be specific in your commit messages, as that allows other developers to see what exactly within the code. You can also use your code editor to 
          commit and push changes as well.
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc">
          Of course, the GitHub server is not <b>our</b> server. To add these changes to our server, log into the Guru cluster.
          We use an internal tool called 'Boxidizer' to update our sites, which is prefixed with <code>bxz</code>.
          Use the command<br>
          <code>bxz update bioinformatics</code><br>
          and if you're an authorized user, all changes from the GitHub server will be
          carried over to the HPC. To make sure changes actually occur after Boxidizer is finished, hit <code>Ctrl+R</code>
          to refresh this page and make sure the changes actually happened. If the website looks buggy, run <br>
          <code>bxz update bioinformatics</code><br>
          This is a weird bug with Boxidizer.
