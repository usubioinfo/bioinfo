        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc text-start">
          This project uses Git and GitHub. Git is software for
          <a href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-source-control#:~:text=These two terms are used,binary files and digital assets."
            class="kbl-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source Control Management</a>. Source control gives us the ability to
          do the following:
        </p>

        <ul class="kbl-text text-thicc text-start px-3">
          <li>- back up our code</li>
          <li>- roll back new changes if the new version is broken</li>
          <li>- allow anyone to work on files without worrying about conflicting changes</li>
          <li>- centralize our repository so that there's no question as to what the latest version is</li>
          <li>- track all changes across a file ever</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc text-start">
          Now, that covers why we use Git, but we also use
          <a class="kbl-link" href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
          as well. GitHub hosts repositories so that we don't have to write our own Git server and manage it ourselves.
          It's also free, and offers many other features that make managing your own repository easier. We personally
          don't require many of these features, as our site is not big enough, but the hosting is very nice to have. Managing
          Git through a GUI is a plus, and we can see changes made to the site much more easily.
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc text-start">
          To use GitHub, you'll first want to
          <a class="kbl-link" href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create an account</a>.
          After you've created an account, open a terminal on your computer. Keep in mind these instructions are for Mac/Linux users.
          In the terminal, type in <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code><br>
          If you get an error, that just means you haven't created a key yet. To create a key, type in
          <code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"</code><br>
          Use the email you signed up to GitHub with. Just hit <code>Enter</code> through the prompts,
          the defaults are okay.
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc text-start">
          Now that you've created a key, use <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code> again. Copy the output of the command,
          it should look like this:<br>
          <code>ssh-ed25519 *long string of characters* name@email.com</code><br>
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc text-start">
          Once you've copied your key, go to your GitHub account and go to your settings, under the top right menu:<br><br>
          <img src="{{ RaikouServer }}/image/bioinfo/kbl-img/findsettings.png" class="img-fluid"/><br><br>
          Then, in your settings, go to 'SSH and GPG keys' and click 'New SSH key' at the top right:<br><br>
          <img src="{{ RaikouServer }}/image/bioinfo/kbl-img/sshkeys.png" class="img-fluid"/><br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc text-start">
          In the 'Title' field, type in any name for the key (something like 'My Desktop'), then paste your key in the 'Key' field and click
          the 'Add SSH key' button. Almost done!
        </p>

        <p class="kbl-text text-thicc text-start">
          The last part of the setup is pretty easy. In a local terminal, type in<br>
          <code>git config --global user.name "YOUR GITHUB USERNAME"</code><br>
          then<br>
          <code>git config --global user.email "YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL@example.com"</code><br><br>
          Make sure these are the credentials you used for your GitHub account.
