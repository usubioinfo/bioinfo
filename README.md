## Dev Environment

After you `git clone` the repo, run `npm install` to install all relevant packages.

To start the dev environment, you'll need two terminal instances open. In one, run `npm run dev-scss` and in the other, run `npm run dev-js`. One of the processes compiles the SCSS automatically and doesn't interfere with the auto-reloading of the NodeJS instance.

Anytime you edit a file, the correct process will do what it needs to do and then restart.
